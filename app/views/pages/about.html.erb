    <p class="about-page-lead">James Building &amp; Property Services has its
    roots in a family partnership founded by <strong>Malcolm and Dianne
    James</strong> in Naracoorte in 1981. What began as ML &amp; DL James
    Carpentry, Joinery &amp; Hardware — supplying trade services and materials
    to the Limestone Coast building community — has grown over four decades
    into a full-service commercial construction and facilities management
    company operating across South Australia and Western Victoria.</p>
    <p class="about-page-lead">The business has always been built on the
    same foundations: quality trade work, reliable people, and the kind of
    long-term relationships that only come from doing the job properly every
    time. That hasn't changed. The scale has.</p>

    <div class="about-page-block-eyebrow">The Founders</div>
    <h2 class="about-page-block-title">Malcolm &amp; <em>Dianne</em> James</h2>
    <div class="about-page-block-body">
      <p>Malcolm James was a carpenter and cabinetmaker who spent years
      supervising construction teams for Sitzler Bros in the Northern
      Territory before returning to South Australia. Multi-skilled across
      all trades, he brought rare practical depth to every project he
      touched.</p>
      <p>Dianne James came from a family with deep roots in hardware and
      plumbing supply. Together, Malcolm and Dianne founded ML &amp; DL James
      in 1981 — initially as a carpentry, joinery, and hardware operation
      supplying plumbers, builders, and tradespeople across the Limestone
      Coast region.</p>
      <p>Through decades of hard work and dedication, they grew the
      partnership into what became James Building &amp; Property Services —
      a business that reflects everything they built it on.</p>

    <div class="about-page-block-body">
      <p>Derek James grew up in the business and now directs James Building
      &amp; Property Services. He holds an <strong>Honours degree in
      Construction Management and Economics</strong> from the University
      of South Australia — a grounding that shapes how JBPS approaches
      every project: rigorous scoping, realistic budgets, and transparent
      delivery from first quote to final handover.</p>
      <p>Derek oversees facilities management and commercial construction
      across regional SA and Victoria, and is actively expanding JBPS's
      footprint in Adelaide with government and community housing
      contracts.</p>
      <p>Beyond the business, Derek has a strong record of community
      service — serving as an <strong>elected member of Naracoorte
      Lucindale Council from 2018 to 2022</strong>, and currently serving
      as <strong>Chair of Hockey SA</strong>, a position he has held for
      two years following six years on the board.</p>
