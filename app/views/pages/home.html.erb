        <h3>ML &amp; DL James — founded by Malcolm &amp; Dianne</h3>
        <p>James Building &amp; Property Services began as ML &amp; DL James, a family partnership founded by Malcolm and Dianne James in Naracoorte, South Australia. Malcolm, a carpenter and cabinetmaker who had honed his skills supervising construction teams for Sitzler Bros in the Northern Territory, brought exceptional trade knowledge and a hands-on work ethic. Dianne came from a family steeped in hardware and plumbing supply, and together they built something genuinely different from the ground up.</p>

        <h3>Carpentry, joinery &amp; hardware</h3>
        <p>In its early years the business operated as ML &amp; DL James Carpentry, Joinery &amp; Hardware — supplying materials and services to plumbers, other builders, and the broader Limestone Coast trade community. Malcolm's multi-trade skills and Dianne's supply background gave the business a breadth that set it apart from single-trade operators from the very beginning.</p>

        <h3>Growing into full construction</h3>
        <p>Through the dedication and hard work of Malcolm and Dianne, the business steadily evolved beyond carpentry and joinery into broader construction and property services. A reputation built on quality trade work and reliability meant that clients kept coming back — and referring others. The foundations of what JBPS is today were laid in this decade.</p>

In 2003, Derek James — Malcolm and Dianne's son — joined the business, bringing an Honours degree in Construction Management and Economics from the University of South Australia and a new generation of leadership to a company already two decades strong.</p>

Quality work. Reliable people. One team you can trust from first call to final handover.</p>
